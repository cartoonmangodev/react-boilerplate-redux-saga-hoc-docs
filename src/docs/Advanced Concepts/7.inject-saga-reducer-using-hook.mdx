## # Inject saga and reducer to the store by using hooks

         Note:
    - By injecting reducer and saga you can able to create your own reducer and saga.
    - It helps in most of the scenarios such as polling,creating your own logic..etc

```javascript {.line-numbers}
import { takeLatest } from "redux-saga/effects";
import {
  useInjectReducer,
  useInjectSaga,
} from "react-boilerplate-redux-saga-hoc";

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  return state;
};
function* getRepos() {}

const saga = function*() {
  yield takeLatest("LOAD_DATA", getRepos);
};

const key = "Dashboard";

const Dashboard = () => {
  useInjectReducer({ key, reducer });
  useInjectSaga({ key, saga });

  return <div />;
};

export default Dashboard;
```
