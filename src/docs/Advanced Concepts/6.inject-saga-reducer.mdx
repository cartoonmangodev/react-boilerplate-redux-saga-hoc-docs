## # Inject saga and reducer to the store

       Note:
    - By injecting reducer and saga you can able to create your own reducer and saga.
    - It helps in most of the scenarios such as polling,creating youer own logic ..etc

```javascript {.line-numbers}
import { takeLatest } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { injectReducer, injectSaga } from "react-boilerplate-redux-saga-hoc";

const initialState = {};
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  return state;
};

function* getRepos() {}

const saga = function*() {
  yield takeLatest("LOAD_DATA", getRepos);
};

const withSaga = injectSaga({ key: "dashboard", saga });
const withReducer = injectReducer({ key: "dashboard", reducer });

export default compose(withSaga, withReducer)(Dashboard);
```
